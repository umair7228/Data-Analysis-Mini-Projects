# Investigating Netflix Movies: A Data Engineering Project
## Overview
This project was completed as part of my Data Engineering training at Saylani Mass IT Training (SMIT) under the guidance of Sir Qasim Hassan. The objective was to analyze trends in the duration of Netflix movies over the past decade using Python and various data analysis libraries.

### Key Insights
- The average duration of Netflix movies has been steadily decreasing from 2011 to 2020.
- Visualizations reveal a clear decline in movie lengths over the years.
- Further analysis indicates that genres like children's movies and documentaries, which tend to be shorter, have contributed significantly to this trend.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas:** Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** Used for creating visualizations and plots.
- **Seaborn:** Enhanced the aesthetic appeal of the plots.

### Project Components
- **Data Analysis:** Detailed exploration of the dataset to identify trends and patterns in movie durations.
- **Visualization:** Creation of clear and informative visualizations to represent the findings.
- **Reporting:** Compilation of insights and visualizations into a comprehensive PDF report.
