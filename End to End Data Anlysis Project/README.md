### Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For scripting and data manipulation
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and preprocessing
- **SQL**: For data analysis and querying

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - Retrieved the dataset from Kaggle.
   - Uploaded the dataset to the Python environment.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Used Python and Pandas to clean and preprocess the data.
   - Handled missing values, corrected data types, and removed duplicates.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Utilized SQL for performing various data analysis tasks.
   - Generated insights and performed complex queries to derive meaningful information.
