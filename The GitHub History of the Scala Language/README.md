## Project Overview

Scala is a mature, general-purpose programming language with a rich history of contributions. This project leverages real-world repository data to analyze the development trajectory of Scala, highlighting key contributors and significant periods of activity.

## Datasets Used

- **pulls_2011-2013.csv**: Basic information about pull requests from the end of 2011 to 2013.
- **pulls_2014-2018.csv**: Basic information about pull requests from 2014 to 2018.
- **pull_files.csv**: Details of files modified by each pull request.
- **pulls.csv**: Details of pulls modified by each pull request.

## Key Analysis

1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**: Combined and cleaned datasets for accurate analysis.
2. **Activity Analysis**: Evaluated the number of pull requests over time to determine active maintenance periods.
3. **Community Dynamics**: Analyzed the distribution of pull requests by contributors to assess community involvement.
4. **Recent Changes**: Identified files modified in the last ten pull requests to pinpoint areas of recent activity.
5. **Contributor Insights**: Determined the top contributors to specific files and their recent activity levels.

## Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations to present the findings clearly:

- Bar charts showing the number of pull requests over time.
- Histograms depicting the distribution of contributions by users.
- Bar plots highlighting the recent contributions by key developers.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the Scala project's development history, offering insights into its maintenance status and community dynamics. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the collaborative efforts behind Scala's evolution.
